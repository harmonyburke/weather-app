# weather-app

## Description

This application is meant to help the user stay informed on the current weather as well as the 5-day weather forecast in the city of their choosing.



## Installation
Visit this webpage at ...

## Usage

To use my weather app, simply type in the name of a valid city and click "search". The app will retrive the information and first display today's weather immediately underneath the search bar. Under todays weather, you will find the 5 day forecast with each corresponding date in chronological order from top to bottom. If you wish to view a city that you have already searched, simply click on the city name again at the top of the page under the seach bar and the results will show once again.



## Credits
I used OpenWeatherMaps API to gather the weather information for this app. I also received help from my tutor (Josshy Olea).
